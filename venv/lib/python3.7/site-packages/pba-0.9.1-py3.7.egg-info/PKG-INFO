Description: PBA
        ========
        
        PBA is a probability bound analysis library for Python. That allows for the creation of pboxes and intervals within python
        
        Probability distributions can be specified using
        ``pba.distname(**args)`` for all distribution that scipy.stats supports.
        Using interval arguments return p-boxes
        
        Intervals can be created using 
        
        Features
